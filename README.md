## Interactive Apple Tree — Inspired by *Stranger Things*

This project is an interactive, animated apple-tree environment that transforms between two parallel worlds:  
a bright and lively day/night world, and an unsettling, corrupted “UpsideDown” world inspired by the TV series **Stranger Things**.

The work is implemented in p5.js and includes multiple interaction systems such as gravity inversion, weather control, and world transformation.

##  How to Interact with the Work

This project contains **two different worlds** you can switch between:

### 🌳 **Normal World (Day/Night)**
- **Press `T`** → Toggle between **Day Mode** and **Night Mode**  
- **Click the Rain Button (☔)** → Turn **Rain On or Off**
- **Click on the Tree Trunk** → Enter the **UpsideDown World**
- Apples grow, fall, land, and re-grow over time.
- In Night mode, apples glow softly and golden fireflies appear.

### 🌑 **UpsideDown World**
- **Click the Tree Trunk again** → Return to the Normal World
- **Click the Smoke Button (☁️)** → Release or dissipate **creepy purple fog**
- Background shifts subtly between cold blues, deep violets, and sickly purples
- Ambient particles drift around the corrupted tree
- Apples become pulsing, corrupted, glowing purple
